if there is a | in the name it means it does not work

just a fyi although there not enough LOC for a few commits, keep in mind I am learning a completely new coding language and scripting with my first experience on game development.
Although the code may not seem like much, I am spending more time on learning as well as the IDE where i'm fixing instances.
There are also multiple scripts in which case I only upload the ones I am working on.

Thank You
:D
